# p(retty-good)lisp

Start of a Lisp based programming language I am building for fun

Using the [Build your own Lisp Book](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) as a guide but hoping to add some more features.

## Running the program

You need to have a C compiler installed.

To compile the program run `cc -std=c99 -Wall main.c mpc/mpc.c -ledit -lm -o main` in the root directory.

To run the program run `./main` in the root directory.
